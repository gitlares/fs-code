# Checkpoint and Resume

Persist iteration state mid-run, then resume from any saved checkpoint into a fresh streaming continuation.

## Overview

A checkpointer captures the agent's full loop state at the end of every iteration: messages, accumulated token usage, per-iteration usage, context budget phase, session and run identity, the local-rewrite flag, the session approval allowlist, and any participating MCP tool bindings. ``Agent/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` loads a saved checkpoint, replays its history into the consuming stream as one synthetic event, then continues live from the next iteration.

This unblocks long-running sessions that need to survive process restarts, UI re-renders, or planned suspension. Checkpoints are written automatically by ``Agent/stream(userMessage:history:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:sessionID:checkpointer:)-(String,_,_,_,_,_,_,_)`` when a `checkpointer` is passed; `sessionID:` is optional, and a fresh ``SessionID`` is minted for the run when it is omitted. Keep your own session ID if you need to find these checkpoints again from another process.

Checkpointing is a streaming capability by design. `run()` takes no session or checkpointer and has no resume entry point; a blocking workload that needs durability should be written as a stream.

## What a Checkpoint Captures

``AgentCheckpoint`` is a `Codable` snapshot. It is written at the end of each iteration after tools execute and before the next request is built.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `messages` | Full conversation including system prompt, user, assistant, and tool messages |
| `iteration` | One-based iteration number that produced this snapshot |
| `tokenUsage` | ``TokenUsageTotals`` for returned responses, preserving measurement coverage |
| `iterationUsage` | Token usage for this iteration alone, when the provider reported it |
| `contextBudgetState` | ``ContextBudgetCheckpointState`` capturing config, window size, last budget snapshot, and the soft-advisory armed flag |
| `historyWasRewrittenLocally` | Whether the agent rewrote history (compaction, pruning) before this iteration |
| `sessionAllowlist` | Tool names the user accepted with `.approveAlways` during this session |
| `sessionID` | Logical session that owns the run |
| `runID` | Run that produced this checkpoint |
| `checkpointID` | Stable identity for the snapshot |
| `timestamp` | UTC time the snapshot was taken |
| `mcpToolBindings` | ``MCPToolBinding`` set: which MCP tools participated in this checkpoint's history |
| `terminalOutcome` | ``AgentTerminalOutcome`` when this checkpoint records a committed completion, `nil` for every ordinary snapshot |

## Backends

``AgentCheckpointer`` is a three-method protocol. Two backends ship with the framework.

| Backend | Use When |
|---|---|
| ``InMemoryCheckpointer`` | The session is bounded by a single process lifetime: previews, tests, transient UI |
| ``FileCheckpointer`` | The session must survive process restart: production apps, server workers, recovery flows |

``FileCheckpointer`` stores one JSON file per checkpoint under `<directory>/checkpoints/<uuid>.json`. ``FileCheckpointer/list(session:)`` skips files it cannot read or decode, so unrelated debris in the directory does not break enumeration. ``FileCheckpointer/load(_:)`` throws ``AgentCheckpointError/fileSystem(_:)`` on the requested file if it is corrupt.

``FileCheckpointer/list(session:)`` returns only the requested session's checkpoints, ordered by iteration and then by timestamp. A session that has been resumed contains checkpoints from several runs; read ``AgentCheckpoint/runID`` from the loaded snapshots to tell them apart.

Custom backends conform to ``AgentCheckpointer`` directly; database-backed and remote-storage implementations are out of scope for the built-in backends. A custom backend must round-trip every field of ``AgentCheckpoint``. Resume treats a loaded checkpoint as authoritative, so a backend that quietly drops ``AgentCheckpoint/terminalOutcome`` turns a committed run back into a live one and re-executes work that already happened.

Checkpoint storage grows without a framework-imposed bound. Every snapshot holds the full message history, ``FileCheckpointer`` writes pretty-printed JSON, a terminal checkpoint stores its exact result twice, and ``AgentCheckpointer`` has no delete operation. Retention and pruning are yours to implement.

## Enabling Checkpointing on a Stream

Pass `checkpointer:` to either entry point, and `sessionID:` when you need to look the checkpoints up later.

```swift
let session = SessionID()
let checkpointer = InMemoryCheckpointer()

let stream = agent.stream(
    userMessage: "Plan and execute the migration.",
    context: ctx,
    sessionID: session,
    checkpointer: checkpointer
)
for try await event in stream {
    handle(event)
}

let savedIDs = try await checkpointer.list(session: session)
```

Omitting `checkpointer:` writes no checkpoint. Without `sessionID:`, the run mints a session ID and includes it on each event as ``StreamEvent/sessionID``.

## Resuming a Run

``Agent/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` loads the named checkpoint, replays its history as one synthetic ``StreamEvent/Kind/iterationCompleted(usage:iteration:history:)`` event tagged with ``EventOrigin/replayed(from:)``, then continues from `iteration + 1`. The event preserves the saved `iterationUsage`, including `nil` when usage was unavailable.

```swift
let stream = try await agent.resume(
    from: checkpointID,
    checkpointer: checkpointer,
    context: ctx
)
for try await event in stream {
    if case .replayed(let id) = event.origin {
        applySnapshot(id)
        continue
    }
    handle(event)
}
```

The resumed run gets a fresh ``RunID`` under the same ``SessionID``. Callers can distinguish replayed events from the live continuation by inspecting ``StreamEvent/origin``.

### Preflight Termination

If the saved checkpoint already exceeds the new `tokenBudget`, the stream replays and finishes with ``FinishReason/tokenBudgetExceeded(budget:used:)`` without making any LLM call. If `iteration >= maxIterations`, it replays and finishes with ``FinishReason/maxIterationsReached(limit:)``.

### Cursor-State Providers

Providers with conversation cursor state (the OpenAI Responses API's `previous_response_id`) cannot reuse a stale cursor after resume because the resumed run is a different run. The first live request after resume forces full history (`.forceFullRequest`) so cursor-state providers reconstruct the conversation from messages rather than from a vanished cursor.

### MCP Binding Validation

Before replay begins, ``Agent/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` checks that every ``MCPToolBinding`` recorded in the checkpoint has a live counterpart on the resuming agent. If any are missing, resume throws ``AgentCheckpointError/mcpBindingMismatch(_:)`` with the missing bindings before any event is yielded. This catches deployment skew where the agent that resumes is configured against fewer or different MCP servers than the agent that saved.

See <doc:MCPIntegration> for how MCP tools are discovered.

## Terminal Checkpoints

An agent built with a `completionTool:` (see <doc:AgentAndChat#Custom-Completion-Tools>) writes one final checkpoint when that tool succeeds. It carries an ``AgentTerminalOutcome`` holding the exact result and the name of the tool that produced it, and it is saved before the top-level `.finished` event is emitted. Every other terminal path — the built-in `finish` tool, content-only completion, max iterations, token budget exhaustion — writes no outcome, and so does a failed or exclusivity-violating completion attempt, which saves an ordinary snapshot and lets the run continue.

Resuming a terminal checkpoint replays the committed result instead of continuing the run. ``Agent/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` validates the saved message structure, checks outcome identity, then emits the saved iteration event followed by `.finished` with the stored content and ``FinishReason/completed``, and closes. The iteration event carries the saved history and optional usage even when the original run reported no measurement. It makes no LLM request, executes no tool, requires no approval handler and no live MCP bindings, applies no budget or iteration preflight, and writes no new checkpoint.

Identity is checked because a terminal checkpoint asserts success on behalf of one specific completion contract. If the resuming agent completes through a different tool, or through the built-in `finish` tool, resume throws ``AgentCheckpointError/completionToolMismatch(checkpointed:live:)`` before any event is yielded.

```swift
do {
    let stream = try await agent.resume(from: id, checkpointer: checkpointer, context: ctx)
    for try await event in stream { handle(event) }
} catch let error as AgentCheckpointError {
    // .completionToolMismatch: this checkpoint belongs to a differently configured agent
    report(error)
}
```

Because tool execution and checkpoint storage are separate awaited operations, a save failure after a successful completion propagates as an error and suppresses `.finished`; it cannot undo whatever the tool already did. Completion tools with external side effects must be idempotent or transactional in their own domain.

## AgentStream Resume

``AgentStream/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` is the SwiftUI-side entry point. It cancels any in-flight prior task before any await runs, loads the checkpoint exactly once, then synchronously preloads observable state before yielding control back to the caller.

```swift
@State private var stream = AgentStream(agent: agent, bufferCapacity: 256)

try await stream.resume(
    from: checkpointID,
    checkpointer: checkpointer,
    context: ctx
)
```

When `resume` returns, these properties are already populated from the checkpoint:

| Property | Source |
|---|---|
| ``AgentStream/sessionID`` | `target.sessionID` |
| ``AgentStream/history`` | `target.messages` |
| ``AgentStream/tokenUsage`` | `target.tokenUsage` |
| ``AgentStream/currentCheckpoint`` | `target.checkpointID` |
| ``AgentStream/terminalContent`` | `target.terminalOutcome.content`, on a terminal checkpoint only |
| ``AgentStream/finishReason`` | ``FinishReason/completed``, on a terminal checkpoint only |

A background task consumes the replay and any live continuation. Observing the synthetic replay event appends its optional usage to ``AgentStream/iterationUsages`` and increments ``AgentStream/iterationsReplayed``, including when usage is `nil`. The counter measures replayed iteration snapshots, not responses with measurements. Neither the synthetic replay nor buffered events record token usage again. Reading buffered events through ``AgentStream/replay(from:)`` does not apply them to observable state again.

See <doc:StreamingAndSwiftUI> for the full SwiftUI contract.

## Cancellation Safety

``AgentStream/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` calls ``AgentStream/cancel()`` and resets observable state before any await. A prior in-flight task cannot continue mutating observers while the new checkpoint loads. The same generation-token discipline that protects ``AgentStream/send(_:history:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:sessionID:checkpointer:)-(String,_,_,_,_,_,_,_)`` against late-arriving stale events applies to resume.

## Cross-Process Resume

``FileCheckpointer`` is safe to use from a fresh process. The directory layout is stable; reopening the same directory and calling ``FileCheckpointer/list(session:)`` returns checkpoints written by an earlier process.

```swift
// Process A
let writer = FileCheckpointer(directory: stateDirectory)
for try await _ in agent.stream(
    userMessage: "Long task...",
    context: ctx, sessionID: session, checkpointer: writer
) {}

// Process B (later)
let reader = FileCheckpointer(directory: stateDirectory)
let ids = try await reader.list(session: session)
guard let last = ids.last else { return }
let stream = try await agent.resume(
    from: last, checkpointer: reader, context: ctx
)
```

The file backend is single-writer oriented. Multi-process coordination over the same directory is the caller's responsibility; for concurrent writers, use a database-backed custom ``AgentCheckpointer``.

## Errors

``AgentCheckpointError`` covers the failure modes that resume can surface:

| Case | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ``AgentCheckpointError/notFound(_:)`` | The named ``CheckpointID`` is not present in the backend |
| ``AgentCheckpointError/fileSystem(_:)`` | A file backend operation failed (read, write, decode for the requested ID) |
| ``AgentCheckpointError/mcpBindingMismatch(_:)`` | Resume cannot continue because one or more recorded MCP bindings have no live counterpart |
| ``AgentCheckpointError/completionToolMismatch(checkpointed:live:)`` | A terminal checkpoint's completion tool is not the resuming agent's; `live` is `nil` for a built-in `finish` agent |

Malformed saved history throws ``AgentError/malformedHistory(_:)`` before the invocation preconditions run, so a data problem is never masked by a missing approval handler or an out-of-range token budget.
