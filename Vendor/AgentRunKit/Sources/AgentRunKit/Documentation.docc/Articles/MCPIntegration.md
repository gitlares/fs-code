# MCP Integration

Connect to external tool servers using the Model Context Protocol.

## Overview

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a standard protocol for exposing tools from external processes. AgentRunKit includes a full MCP client: configure servers, discover their tools at startup, and pass those tools to ``Agent`` or ``Chat`` alongside native tools.

## Configuring Servers

``MCPServerConfiguration`` describes how to launch and communicate with an MCP server.

```swift
let config = MCPServerConfiguration(
    name: "filesystem",
    command: "/usr/local/bin/mcp-filesystem",
    arguments: ["--root", "/tmp"],
    environment: ["LOG_LEVEL": "warn"],
    initializationTimeout: .seconds(10),
    toolCallTimeout: .seconds(30)
)
```

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | (required) | Unique identifier for this server |
| `command` | (required) | Absolute path to the server executable |
| `arguments` | `[]` | Command-line arguments |
| `environment` | `nil` | Extra environment variables (merged with the current process environment) |
| `workingDirectory` | `nil` | Working directory for the server process |
| `initializationTimeout` | 30s | Deadline for the handshake and tool discovery |
| `toolCallTimeout` | 60s | Per-call deadline for `tools/call` requests |

## Session Lifecycle

``MCPSession`` manages the full lifecycle: process launch, protocol handshake, tool discovery, and shutdown. Construct it with one or more configurations, then use the ``MCPSession/withTools(_:)`` closure to scope the connection.

```swift
let session = MCPSession(configurations: [filesystemConfig, searchConfig])

let result: AgentResult = try await session.withTools { (mcpTools: [any AnyTool<EmptyContext>]) in
    let agent = Agent(client: client, tools: nativeTools + mcpTools)
    return try await agent.run(userMessage: "List files in /tmp", context: EmptyContext())
}
```

When the closure returns (or throws), all servers are shut down and their processes terminated. Servers connect in parallel, so adding more servers does not increase startup time linearly.

## Multiple Servers

Pass multiple ``MCPServerConfiguration`` values to a single session. All servers connect concurrently. Tool names must be globally unique across all connected servers. If two servers expose a tool with the same name, ``MCPSession/withTools(_:)`` throws ``MCPError/duplicateToolName(tool:servers:)``.

## MCPTool

``MCPTool`` adapts each discovered MCP tool to the ``AnyTool`` protocol. Once inside the `withTools` closure, MCP tools are indistinguishable from native ``Tool`` instances. The agent calls them through the same interface, and their results follow the same ``ToolResult`` type.

## Tool Result Content

``MCPCallResult/content`` preserves the decoded ``MCPContent`` blocks returned by a server. ``MCPContent/resourceLink(uri:name:)`` carries a URI and a required name. ``MCPContent/embeddedResource(uri:mimeType:content:)`` carries a URI, an optional MIME type, and ``MCPResourceContent``: `.text(String)` preserves text, and `.blob(Data)` preserves decoded binary bytes.

The protocol permits a resource to satisfy both text and blob schemas. Decoding prefers a valid text string, including an empty string; otherwise it accepts a valid blob representation. Fields belonging only to the other representation do not invalidate the selected one. Missing both representations, malformed required fields, and invalid base64 in the selected blob representation fail decoding.

``MCPCallResult/toToolResult()`` provides the text projection used by ``MCPTool``. Structured content takes precedence when available. Otherwise, text blocks and embedded text are joined with the other content, resource links render as `[name](uri)`, and binary resources render as `[Embedded resource]`. The original binary data remains in the call result. Links are not fetched as part of a tool call.

## Checkpoint Binding Validation

When a checkpointed run includes MCP tool calls, the agent loop records each participating tool as an ``MCPToolBinding`` in ``AgentCheckpoint/mcpToolBindings``. On resume, ``Agent/resume(from:checkpointer:context:tokenBudget:requestContext:approvalHandler:)`` validates that every recorded binding has a live counterpart with the same `serverName` and `toolName`. Missing bindings throw ``AgentCheckpointError/mcpBindingMismatch(_:)`` before any event is yielded, catching deployment skew where the resuming agent is configured against a different MCP server set. See <doc:CheckpointAndResume>.

## Error Handling

``MCPError`` covers all failure modes:

| Case | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ``MCPError/connectionFailed(_:)`` | Transport failed to connect or server process did not start |
| ``MCPError/serverStartFailed(server:message:)`` | Named server failed during launch |
| ``MCPError/protocolVersionMismatch(requested:supported:)`` | Client and server disagree on protocol version |
| ``MCPError/requestTimeout(method:)`` | A JSON-RPC request exceeded its deadline |
| ``MCPError/duplicateToolName(tool:servers:)`` | Two servers expose the same tool name |
| ``MCPError/jsonRPCError(code:message:)`` | Server returned a JSON-RPC error response |
| ``MCPError/transportClosed`` | The transport connection dropped unexpectedly |
| ``MCPError/invalidResponse(_:)`` | Response could not be interpreted |
| ``MCPError/decodingFailed(_:)`` | Response payload failed to decode |

## JSON-RPC Lifecycle

``MCPClient`` implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lifecycle over JSON-RPC:

1. **initialize**: client sends protocol version and capabilities, server responds with its version
2. **notifications/initialized**: client confirms the handshake
3. **tools/list**: client discovers available tools (paginated via cursor)
4. **tools/call**: client invokes a tool by name with JSON arguments
5. **shutdown**: client closes the transport and terminates the server process

``MCPSession`` handles steps 1 through 3 automatically before entering the `withTools` closure, and step 5 when the closure exits.
